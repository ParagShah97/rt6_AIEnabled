Use the steps below to build the turbo JS file for RT. If you don't have
them, you will need to install recent versions of: yarn, node, tsc, jsmin
and all dependencies.

1) Download the tarball from Releases on GitHub for the version you want.
2) Unpack.
3) In the unpacked turbo directory, run:

    yarn run build

   That should create dist/turbo.es2017-esm.js
4) To create a minified version:

    jsmin <dist/turbo.es2017-esm.js > dist/turbo.es2017-esm.min.js

5) Copy the new file to RT's share/static/js.
